[#download-tutorial-sources]
== Download Tutorial Sources
Before we start to setting up the environment, lets clone the tutorial sources and call the cloned folder as `$TUTORIAL_HOME`

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/knative-tutorial
----

The `work` folder in `$TUTORIAL_HOME` can be used to download the demo application resources and refer them during the exercises. The `work` folder has a README, which has instructions on source code repo and git commands to clone the sources.

[IMPORTANT]
====

This tutorial was developed and tested with:

- Knative `v0.4.0`
- minikube `v0.35.0`
- OpenShift `v3.11`
- minishift `v1.30.0+186b034`
====

[#install-knative-minikube]
=== Minikube

[#start-minikube]
==== Configure and Start minikube 

Before installing Knative and its components, we need to add few startup config to minikube.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
minikube profile knative \#<1>

minikube start -p knative --memory=8192 --cpus=4 \#<2> 
  --kubernetes-version=v1.12.0 \#<3> 
  --vm-driver=hyperkit \#<4>  
  --disk-size=50g"
----

<1> Setting minikube profile to **knative** so that all future minikube commands are executed with this profile context
<2> Starting a profile named **knative**
<3> Minimum kubernetes version needs to be >= 1.12.0, refer to issue https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/3067 for more details.
<4> If you are on linux then use `--vm-driver=kvm2`

[#install-knative-istio]
==== Install Istio 

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl apply --filename {knative-serving-repo}/{knative-version}/istio-crds.yaml
kubectl apply --filename {knative-serving-repo}/{knative-version}/istio.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
Installation of istio components will take some time and its highly recommended that you start Knative components installation only after you see all istio component pods are running. The istio pods can be watched using the command:
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl -n istio-system get pods -w 
----
You can use kbd:[CTRL + c ] to terminate the watch
====

A successful istio install will have the pods running in `istio-system` namespace as shown below:

[#set-knative-tutorial-ns]
==== Configuring Kubernetes namespace

We will use a non default kubernetes namespace called `knativetutorial` for all the tutorial exercises.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace knativetutorial
----

[#install-knative-openshift]
=== OpenShift 

For OpenShift Knative installations we will use the OpenShift Cloud Function's https://github.com/openshift-cloud-functions/knative-operators[Knative Operators].

Clone the Knative Operator sources locally:

[source,bash,linenums]
-----
cd $TUTORIAL_HOME/work
git clone https://github.com/openshift-cloud-functions/knative-operators
cd knative-operators
-----

[#install-knative-ocp]
==== OCP

If you have an existing OpenShift cluster then run the following commands:

[source,bash,linenums]
-----
./etc/scripts/install.sh
-----

If you need more details about the installation or customizations refer https://github.com/openshift-cloud-functions/Documentation/blob/master/knative-OCP.md[Knative with OpenShift].

[#install-knative-minishift]
==== minishift

Run the following commands to configure Knative with minishift:

[source,bash,linenums]
-----
./etc/scripts/install-on-minishift.sh #<1>
-----

<1> It will create a minishift profile and install knative.  It also assumes that you already have minishift and your computer has 10GB or more of memory

[#configure-openshift-project]
==== Configuring OpenShift project for Knative applications

[source,bash,linenums]
----
oc new-project knativetutorial
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default #<1>
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
----

<1> The `oc adm policy` adds the **privileged** https://docs.okd.io/3.10/admin_guide/manage_scc.html[Security Context Constraints(SCCs)]to the **default** Service Account. The SCCs are the precursor to the PSP (Pod Security Policy) mechanism in kubernetes.

[#setup-work-folder]
== Work folder

The work folder i.e `$TUTORIAL_HOME/work` can be used as a work directory during the build. The README in the work folder as the GitHub repository links of the applications `greeter` and `event-greeter` that will be used in various exercises.
